# Student Gradebook System
A developed student grade input system that gathers a list of students, takes the average of each student of their inputted grades, and uses a heap algorithms for student ranking regarding their grade performance. Once all calculations are made and the needed information is gathered for the gradebook, it is then saved for viewing as a .txt file after full program execution.

The main goal of this project is to maintain understanding of computer science fundamentals regarding data structures and algorithms, saving data to a file, and python syntax.
